# Cynthia-Ugwu-Portfolio-Clone
This project is a faithful clone of Cynthia Ugwu's captivating portfolio website. Through this endeavor, I aimed to hone my web development skills and pay tribute to Cynthia's exceptional design. The clone faithfully replicates the original site's layout, styling, and interactivity, showcasing my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
